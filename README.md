# 150DaysOfALC4

## DAY 1
I've always wanted to learn more about __Progressive Web Apps__ so after setting up my pc and installing all installables, I jumped right into Progressive Web Apps Fundamentals and learning!

### Lessons
PWAs should be: 
_Responsive_
_Work offline_
_App-like Interaction_
_Fresh_
_safe_
_Discoverable_
_Re-engageable_
_Installable_
_Linkable_

I also started learning about the *web manifest* working towards making **Bookey** installable! :)

### RESOURCES/ FUN FACTS:
[FaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) is used to generate favicons and _manifest.json_ files for making a web app installable!

I spent over 2 hours trying to figure out the error while to testing my BOOKEY for installablity without knowing the I provided the wrong path as the _src_ of _icons_ for andriod display :)

## DAY 2

Finished the Semantic HTML course and started Meeting Web #a11y Guidelines! 
Did you know we have caption tag for the title of a table?
With role="img" and title we can also make #svg accessible?
Updates PWA with BooKey: I encountered a blocker

### NOTE

I need to study more on manifest events
I just installed it on my phone using "add to home screen" ft, but I got an error from GitHub when trying to access the page. What'd be the cause? 

# Day 3&4
Started the Practical #html5 course, coding along with instructor to build an online store!
I just learned that header can l be used more than once! Float and Clear became more clearer and I'm not even done with module 3!
