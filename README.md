# 150DaysOfALC4

## DAY 1
I've always wanted to learn more about __Progressive Web Apps__ so after setting up my pc and installing all installables, I jumped right into Progressive Web Apps Fundamentals and learning!

### Lessons
PWAs should be: 
_Responsive_
_Work offline_
_App-like Interaction_
_Fresh_
_safe_
_Discoverable_
_Re-engageable_
_Installable_
_Linkable_

I also started learning about the *web manifest* working towards making **Bookey** installable! :)

### RESOURCES/ FUN FACTS:
[FaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) is used to generate favicons and _manifest.json_ files for making a web app installable!

I spent over 2 hours trying to figure out the error while to testing my BOOKEY for installablity without knowing the I provided the wrong path as the _src_ of _icons_ for andriod display :)
